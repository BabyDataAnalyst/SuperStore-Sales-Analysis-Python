## 📃 Insights from the Charts

1️⃣ Sales by Region
The West and East regions are leading in sales, contributing the most revenue.
In contrast, Central and South regions are lagging behind, indicating potential areas for sales improvement or strategic focus.

2️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend
Sales show seasonal fluctuations with several peaks and dips, but the overall trend is positive and growing steadily from 2015 to 2018.
A significant spike in late 2018 suggests strong year-end performance, possibly due to holiday sales or seasonal promotions.

3️⃣ Sales by Category
Technology dominates as the top-selling category, outperforming Furniture and Office Supplies.
However, Furniture and Office Supplies are not far behind, showing consistent contribution to overall revenue.
This indicates a balanced sales mix, but Technology is the key revenue driver.
